This is a fleet management system (just a demo and unfinished version) made with **Symfony**, **Bootstrap** and **JQuery**.
This project was developed as my final year internship along with an android app for the parc manager.
The main purpose of this application is to help monitor the company's vehicules from the data given both by the parc manager and the user of this system then it will give back report.
